# Hello
Hello fellow citizens of the **Realm of Computer Orders**[^a]
You've found this, my profile location.\
Check out the rest of the repository [here](https://github.com/Axolotls7/Axolotls7), there's some random things for you to look at and maybe test.\
I am also working on [an Alchemy Simulator](https://github.com/Funderboogs/Alchemist-Simulator), but that's a private repository.\
I don't know how releases are affected by their repository being private, so i'll put that list [here](https://github.com/Funderboogs/Alchemist-Simulator/releases/tag/v0.1.0-alpha)
