# If you are not an admin, this doesn't apply to you. Please leave




## PWD
The default password for the admin account is ADMIN. Change it using these steps:
1. use //ADMIN to **kill** the admin acount
2. sign in with a new account whose username is admin.

## Admin Powers
The admin account has special powers that can be used using the //ADMIN command.
Current //ADMIN powers:
- **kill:** deletes an account.
- **show:** allows you to see the (encrypted) passwords for the other accounts.
The //ADMIN command does not directly interface with the admin powers.\
Instead, it interfaces with an AI named "Computer."\
Why this unimaginative name? Good question.\
Moving on, this AI is technically female. This does not currently come up in\
conversation (usually), but we support the L G B T Q Q I P 2S A AI+ community, so *she* is not an *"it."*
