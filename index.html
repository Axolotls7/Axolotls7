        <p>Hey this is my profile readme's repository's page on my profile site.</p>
        <p>Why I decided to make this I have no idea, so don't ask me.</p>
        <p>Note (21/25.3.22): I actually forgot that this existed. But then I found it and changed it from a half-[ahh]ed piece of garbage (pronounced /gɑɹbɑʒ/) to something vaguely reasonable.</p>
        <p>Note (21/25.3.22): Go to <a href="https://axolotls7.github.io/weird-stuff/time">this page here</a> to see what I mean when I say 21/25.3.22</p>
